<br>

# Changes on this version (06/03/2025)
- Replaced some characters from the frames file for a cleaner view.
- Set console sizes (tested on Windows) which were missing on the original version.
- Added audio playback using NAudio + Tried my best to sync music and visual
- Speed changed to match the original video (inconsistant framerate yet to be fixed)
# Details

> The original video used was 60FPS, but the final result has inconsistant framerate. Audio is a bit off due to some limitations that I don't fully understand, I will try to fix it in the future. 

I have only tested the project on the Windows 10 console (project sets it to 151ch x 45lines by default)
